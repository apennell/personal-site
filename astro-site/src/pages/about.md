# Something about me

In 2023, I established [Sparkbird Works](https://sparkbird.works), a studio
where I offer freelance engineering, consulting, and coaching services, with a
focus on web accessibility (a11y) and sustainability. I am always eager to
learn, grow, share, and create, and I believe in the power of ethical web
development to make a positive impact.
